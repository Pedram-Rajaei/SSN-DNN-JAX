# SSN-DNN-JAX
SSM-DNN-JAX is an implementation of State-Space Model-driven Deep Neural Networks (SSM-DNNs) using JAX, optimized for efficient training and inference with automatic differentiation. This repository includes well-documented code, example notebooks, and benchmarks to demonstrate the integration of SSMs in deep learning applications.
