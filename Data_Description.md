<h2>Data Description</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset used in this study comprises behavioral data collected during a Death Implicit Association Task (D-IAT), designed to investigate implicit cognitive processing related to suicidal ideation. Participants were stratified into two groups—High Suicidal Ideation (High SI) and Low Suicidal Ideation (Low SI)—based on ecological momentary assessment (EMA) responses collected over a two-week period. This stratification aimed to capture differences in behavioral patterns associated with varying levels of active SI, as reflected in moment-to-moment assessments rather than clinical diagnosis alone. Data collection was conducted under IRB approval (Advarra IRB, approved on 01/05/2024). A total of XX participants’ data out of XX were included in the analysis (remaining data were excluded due to low task engagement, defined as missing over 200 trials or performance accuracy below chance level).

    The D-IAT required participants to categorize stimulus words by matching them to one of two conceptual headers: "Life + Me" or "Death + Me". Words were presented sequentially, and participants indicated a semantic match or mismatch by pressing one of two arrow keys. To counterbalance response mappings, participants with odd-numbered subject IDs pressed the right arrow key for a match and the left arrow key for a mismatch, while those with even-numbered IDs used the reverse mapping. Participants had 2.0 seconds to respond to each trial. Header categories alternated every 20 trials to reduce response bias and increase cognitive variability. The stimuli included self-referential words (e.g., "I", "Myself"), positive life-related terms (e.g., "Alive", "Happy"), and death-related terms (e.g., "Dead", "Die", "Sad"), selected to elicit semantic associations relevant to the task structure.

    Each participant completed 360 trials, structured into 18 blocks of 20 trials each. Both reaction times (RTs) and accuracy were recorded for each trial. While average RTs across block types ("Death + Me" vs. "Life + Me") did not reveal significant differences between the High SI and Low SI groups, dynamic RT patterns across trials exhibited rhythmic modulations temporally aligned with block transitions. These rhythmic patterns were particularly pronounced in participants with Low SI scores, suggesting that temporal structure in RT trajectories may reflect underlying cognitive regulation processes differentially expressed across SI levels.
    In this study, we use RT data to explore how active suicidal ideation is encoded in temporal patterns of implicit task performance.
